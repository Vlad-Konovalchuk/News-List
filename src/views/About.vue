            <h1>The European languages </h1>
            <p>
                The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth.
                For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. 
                Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. 
                To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.
